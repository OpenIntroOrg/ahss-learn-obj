\begin{enumerate}
\renewcommand\labelenumi{\textcolor{light}{\textbf{LO \theenumi.}}}

\item Define trial, outcome, and sample space.

\item Explain why the long-run relative frequency of repeated independent events settle down to the true probability as the number of trials increases, i.e. why the law of large numbers holds.

\item Distinguish disjoint (also called mutually exclusive) and independent events.
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] If A and B are independent, then having information on A does not tell us anything about B.
\item[-] If A and B are disjoint, then knowing that A occurs tells us that B cannot occur.
\item[-] Disjoint (mutually exclusive) events are always dependent since if one event occurs we know the other one cannot.
\end{itemize}

\item Draw Venn diagrams representing events and their probabilities.

\item Define a probability distribution as a list of the possible outcomes with corresponding probabilities that satisfies three rules: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] The outcomes listed must be disjoint. 
\item[-] Each probability must be between 0 and 1, inclusive.
\item[-] The probabilities must total 1. 
\end{itemize}

\item Define complementary outcomes as mutually exclusive outcomes of the same random process whose probabilities add up to 1. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] If A and B are complementary, $ P(A) + P(B) = 1$. 
\end{itemize}

\item Distinguish between union of events (A or B) and intersection of events (A and B).
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Calculate the probability of union of events using the (general) addition rule.
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] If A and B are not mutually exclusive, $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$ 
\item[+] If A and B are mutually exclusive, $P(A \text{ or } B) = P (A) + P (B)$, since for mutually exclusive events $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0$.
\end{itemize}
\item[-] Calculate the probability of intersection of independent events using the multiplication rule.
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] If A and B are dependent, $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B | A)$
\item[+] If A and B are independent, $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$,  since for independent events $P(B|A)=P(B)$.

\item What is the probability of getting a head on the 6th coin flip if in the first 5 flips the coin landed on a head each time?
\item True / False: Being right handed and having blue eyes are mutually exclusive events.
\item P(A) = 0.5, P(B) = 0.6, there are no other possible outcomes in the sample space. What is P(A and B)?

Create a contingency table and a tree diagram summarizing these probabilities. Calculate the percentage of students in this class who are in a relationship.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\renewcommand\labelenumi{\textcolor{light}{\textbf{LO \theenumi.}}}
\item Determine if a random variable is binomial using the four conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] The trials are independent. 
\item[-] The number of trials, n, is fixed. 
\item[-] Each trial outcome can be classified as a success or failure. 
\item[-] The probability of a success, p, is the same for each trial. 
\end{itemize}

\item Calculate the number of possible scenarios for obtaining $k$ successes in $n$ trials using the choose function: ${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!~(n - k)!}$.

\item Calculate probability of a given number of successes in a given number of trials using the binomial distribution: $P(K = k) = \frac{n!}{k!~(n - k)!}~p^k~(1-p)^{(n - k)}$.

\item[-] Assigning digits to represent outcomes
\item[-] Simulating many repetitions using the random digit table, stopping when appropriate.
