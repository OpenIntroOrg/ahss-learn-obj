\item Use scatterplots for describing the relationship between two numerical variables making sure to note the direction (positive or negative), form (linear or non-linear) and the strength of the relationship as well as any unusual observations that stand out.
\item When describing the distribution of a numerical variable, mention its shape, center, and spread, as well as any unusual observations.
\item Note that there are three commonly used measures of center and spread: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] center: mean (the arithmetic average), median (the midpoint), mode (the most frequent observation).
\item[-] spread: spread: standard deviation (variability around the mean), range (max-min), interquartile range (middle 50\% of the distribution).
\end{itemize}
\item Identify the shape of a distribution as symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed, and unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, or uniform.
\item Find the 5 number summary and IQR, and draw a box plot with outliers shown.
\item Create stem-and-leaf plots, dot plots, and histograms to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable.  
\item Use the above three graphs along with box plots to identify the shape, center, and spread of numerical distributions.  
\item Calculate, interpret, and apply Standard Deviation as a measure of spread about the mean.
\item Define a robust statistic (e.g. median, IQR) as measures that are not heavily affected by skewness and extreme outliers, and determine when they are more appropriate measured of center and spread compared to other similar statistics.
\item Recognize when transformations (e.g. log) can make the distribution of data more symmetric, and hence easier to model.

\item Use frequency tables and bar plots to describe the distribution of one categorical variable.
\item Use contingency tables and segmented bar plots or mosaic plots to assess the relationship between two categorical variables.
\item Use back-to-back stem-and-leaf plots, side-by-side box plots, or pairs of dot plots/histograms for comparing the distribution of a numerical variable across multiple groups (e.g. male/female).

%\item Interpret the plot in Figure 1.40 (page 39) of the textbook.
\item You collect data on 100 classmates, 70 females and 30 males. 10\% of the class are smokers, and smoking is independent of gender. Calculate how many males and females would be expected to be smokers. Sketch a bar graph of this scenario. \\

\item Note that an observed difference in sample statistics suggesting dependence between variables may be due to random chance, and that we need to use hypothesis testing to determine if this difference is too large to be attributed to random chance.
\item Set up null and alternative hypotheses for testing for independence between variables, and evaluate data's support for these hypotheses using a simulation technique.
