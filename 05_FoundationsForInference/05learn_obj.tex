\item Define sample statistic as a point estimate for a population parameter, for example, the sample proportion is used to estimate the population proportion, and note that point estimate and sample statistic are synonymous.

\item Recognize that point estimates (such as the sample proportion or mean) will vary from one sample to another, and define this variability as sampling variation.

\item Calculate the sampling variability of the proportion, the standard deviation of the sample proportion, as $SD = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$, where $p$ is the population proportion.

\item Note that when the population proportion $p$ is not known (almost always), the sample proportion is used, yielding the Standard Error, $SE =\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$.


\item Recognize that when the sample size increases we would expect the sampling variability to decrease.
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Conceptually: Imagine taking many samples from the population. When sample sizes are large the sample proportions or means will be much more consistent across samples than when the sample sizes are small.
\item[-] Mathematically: $SE =\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$, when $n$ increases, $SE$ will decrease since $n$ is in the denominator.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Calculate the sampling variability of the mean, the standard deviation of the mean, as $SD_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[-] Note that when the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is not known (almost always), the sample standard deviation is used, yielding the Standard Error, $SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$.
%\end{itemize}

%\item Distinguish standard deviation ($\sigma$ or $s$) and standard error ($SE$): standard deviation measures the variability in the data, while standard error measures the variability in point estimates from different samples of the same size and from the same population, i.e. measures the sampling variability.

\item Define a confidence interval as the plausible range of values for a population parameter.

\item Define the confidence level as the percentage of random samples which yield confidence intervals that capture the true population parameter.

\item Calculate an approximate 95\% confidence interval by adding and subtracting 2 standard errors to the point estimate: $point~estimate \pm 2 \times SE$.

\item Recognize that the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is about the distribution of point estimates, and that given certain conditions, this distribution will be nearly normal.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item[-] In the case of the mean the CLT tells us that if
%\begin{itemize}[parsep=0pt]
%\item[(1a)] the sample size is sufficiently large $(n \ge 30)$ and the data are not extremely skewed or
%\item[(1b)] the population is known to have a normal distribution, and
%\item[(2)] the observations in the sample are independent,
%\end{itemize}
%then the distribution of the sample mean will be nearly normal, centered at the true population mean and with a standard error of $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
%\[ \bar{x} \sim N \left( mean = \mu, SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \]
%\item[-] When the population distribution is unknown, condition (1a) can be checked using a histogram or some other visualization of the distribution of the observed data in the sample.
%\item[-] The larger the sample size ($n$), the less important that the shape of the distribution becomes, i.e. when $n$ is very large the sampling distribution will be nearly normal regardless of the shape of the population distribution.
%\end{itemize}

\item Recall that independence of observations in a sample is provided by random sampling (in the case of observational studies) or random assignment (in the case of experiments).
\item Know that if the sample is large compared to the population, or more precisely, is greater than 10\% of the population, the SE estimate will be inaccurate (it will, in fact, overestimate, causing the confidence interval to be wider than necessary).\

\item Recognize that the nearly normal distribution of the point estimate (as suggested by the CLT) implies that a more general confidence interval can be calculated as
\[ point~estimate \pm z^{\star} \times SE, \] 
where $z^{\star}$ corresponds to the cutoff points in the standard normal distribution to capture the middle XX\% of the data, where XX\% is the desired confidence level.
\begin{itemize}
%\item[-] For means this is $\bar{x} \pm Z^\star \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$.
\item[-] Note that $z^{\star}$ is always positive.
\end{itemize}

\item Define margin of error as the distance required to travel in either direction away from the point estimate when constructing a confidence interval, i.e. $z^{\star} \times SE$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Notice that this corresponds to half the width of the confidence interval.
\end{itemize}

\item Interpret a confidence interval as ``We are XX\% confident that the true population parameter is in this interval", where XX\% corresponds to the confidence level.
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Note that your interpretation must always be in context of the data -- mention what the population is and what the parameter is (mean or proportion).

%Hint: First check if we should expect the sample mean to be distributed nearly normally, i.e. if the CLT holds. If so, sketch a normal curve with mean $\mu$ and the appropriate standard error. Shade the area you're interested in, and calculate it using methods we learned in the previous unit.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\renewcommand\labelenumi{\textcolor{light}{\textbf{LO \theenumi.}}}

\item Explain how the hypothesis testing framework resembles a court trial.

\item Recognize that in hypothesis testing we evaluate two competing claims: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] the null hypothesis, which represents a skeptical perspective or the status quo, and 
\item[-] the alternative hypothesis, which represents an alternative under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible parameter values.
\end{itemize}

\item Construction of hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Always construct hypotheses about population parameters (e.g. population proportion, $p$) and not the sample statistics (e.g. sample proportion, $\hat{p}$). Note that the population parameter is unknown while the sample statistic is measured using the observed data and hence there is no point in hypothesizing about it.
\item[-] Define the null value as the value the parameter is set to equal in the null hypothesis.
\item[-] Note that the alternative hypothesis might be one-sided ($p$ $<$ or $>$ the null value) or two-sided ($p$ $\ne$ the null value), and the choice depends on the research question.
\end{itemize}

\item Define a p-value as the conditional probability of obtaining a sample statistic at least as extreme as the one observed given that the null hypothesis is true.
\[ \text{p-value} = \text{P(observed or more extreme sample statistic}~|~H_0 \text{ true)} \]

\item Calculate a p-value as the area under the normal curve beyond the calculated test statistic (either in one tail or both, depending on the alternative hypothesis). %Note that in doing so you can use a Z score, where
%\[ Z = \frac{sample~statistic - null~value}{SE} = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{SE} \]
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Always sketch the normal curve when calculating the p-value, and shade the appropriate area(s) depending on whether the alternative hypothesis is one- or two-sided.
\end{itemize}

\item Infer that if a confidence interval does not contain the null value the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative.

\item Compare the p-value to the significance level to make a decision between the hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] If the p-value $<$ the significance level, reject the null hypothesis since this means that obtaining a sample statistics at least as extreme as the observed data is extremely unlikely to happen just by chance, and conclude that the data provides evidence for the alternative hypothesis.
\item[-] If the p-value $>$ the significance level, fail to reject the null hypothesis since this means that obtaining a sample statistics at least as extreme as the observed data is quite likely to happen by chance, and conclude that the data does not provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis.
\item[-] Note that we can never ``accept" the null hypothesis since the hypothesis testing framework does not allow us to confirm it.
\end{itemize}

\item Note that the conclusion of a hypothesis test might be erroneous regardless of the decision we make.
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Define a Type 1 error as rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is actually true.
\item[-] Define a Type 2 error as failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is actually true.
\end{itemize}

\item Choose a significance level depending on the risks associated with Type 1 and Type 2 errors.
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Use a smaller $\alpha$ is Type 1 error is relatively riskier.
\item[-] Use a larger $\alpha$ is Type 2 error is relatively riskier.
\end{itemize}

\item Define power as the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (complement of Type 2 error).

\item Explain how power changes for changes in effect size, sample size, significance level, and standard error.
